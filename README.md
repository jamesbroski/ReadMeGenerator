# ReadMeGenerator

Here is the README.md Generator I have built for this latest assignment:

The user should input information through the Command Line Interface (CLI)

The user will be asked a series of questions that will then input that information onto the README.md file that will be created by the end

Once the user has finished all of the prompts with their desired information, the README.md file is generated automatically for them to attach to their repo.

This tool is very useful as it will easily create README.md files for all future porjects with ease!

Here is a link to view the product in action: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qT9Y5mC10Y50XsM_LU2UJ0fk9JHDAyuF/view

Below is a screenshot/gif of what the user should expect when using this tool:

(The gif file size is 10MB so it is hard to see the actual details, but it works!)

Please feel free to give this README.md Generator a go if you are ever in need of a resource like this!
